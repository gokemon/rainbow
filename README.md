# Rainbow

This is an Amazing Responsive Admin Templates and Themes Package with Bootstrap & AngularJS.

![Preview of the rainbow themed bootstrap-based admin tool using angular](https://github.com/gokemon/rainbow/blob/master/Preview.png)

Rainbow is a fully responsive admin web App built with Bootstrap 3x & AngularJS 1x. It uses Sass CSS which makes it easy to modify.

Part of the contents on this project

There is the **rainbow** folder where the "core-code" project lives. The bower, gitignore, gulp and package.json files all live.

There is the **documentation** folder where the instructions on how to use it, and what the specs are.

And the **dist** folder where the outputted files for distribution and deployment live. 

So all in all quite a challenge to** *get the git*.** 

## Libraries Used ##
Libraries you will have at your command;
- jquery  (which I have used before)
- angular (which I have used before)
- angular-animate (which I have used before)
- angular-ui-router (used before, but still trying to separate the node/express router, and ng-router stuff in my head)
- angular-aria
- angular-bootstrap and its lovely
- font-awesome
- bootstrap-file-input, and the angular roll-call resumes,
- angular-scroll
- angular-ui-calendar
- angular-validation-match
- angular-wizard (which does what, I have no idea)
- weather-icons
- webfontloader
- fullcalendar (which I have never used yet)

## Automation with Gulp ##
Gulp is a JavaScript task runner, and its list of devDependencies is also quite long. 

## How to Use It? ##
Check out the How to Use It section in the documentation. But it is built on Node.js, Angular.js, as you know uses Gulp.js, and Bower for workflow. And Ruby for the SASS, and compass for windows SASS work(so you know I like it).


## Basic Template Structure ##
The basic structure of template (index.html) is quiet simple. It contains 3 parts: The header, which load all the stylesheets. The body, which contains the content of App. The footer, which load all the scripts.
